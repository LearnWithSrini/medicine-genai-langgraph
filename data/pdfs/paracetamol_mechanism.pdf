Paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamic
heat-regulating center. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous
system. Unlike NSAIDs, it has minimal anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol
is safe in therapeutic doses but may cause severe liver injury in overdose.
