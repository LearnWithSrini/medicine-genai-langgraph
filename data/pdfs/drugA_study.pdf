Title: Efficacy and Safety of DrugA in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

Abstract:
DrugA is an oral inhibitor of the DPP-4 enzyme designed to improve glycaemic control in adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).
A Phase III randomized controlled trial compared DrugA 100 mg daily with placebo across 1,200 patients.

Results:
Patients receiving DrugA achieved a mean HbA1c reduction of 1.1% compared with 0.3% in the placebo group.
DrugA was generally well tolerated with mild nasopharyngitis and headache being the most common adverse events.

Conclusion:
DrugA demonstrated statistically significant improvements in glycaemic control with an acceptable safety profile.
